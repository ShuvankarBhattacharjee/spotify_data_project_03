**Project data source - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sanjanchaudhari/spotify-dataset**

**Overview**<br>
This project involves analyzing a Spotify dataset with various attributes about tracks, albums, and artists using SQL. It covers an end-to-end process of normalizing a denormalized dataset, performing SQL queries of varying complexity (easy, medium, and advanced), and optimizing query performance. The primary goals of the project are to practice advanced SQL skills and generate valuable insights from the dataset.

**Project Steps**<br>
**1. Data Exploration**
Before diving into SQL, itâ€™s important to understand the dataset thoroughly. The dataset contains attributes such as:<br>
Artist: The performer of the track.<br>
Track: The name of the song.<br>
Album: The album to which the track belongs.<br>
Album_type: The type of album (e.g., single or album).<br>
Various metrics such as danceability, energy, loudness, tempo, and more.<br>

**4. Querying the Data**<br>
After the data is inserted, various SQL queries can be written to explore and analyze the data. Queries are categorized into easy, medium, and advanced levels to help progressively develop SQL proficiency.
Easy Queries
Simple data retrieval, filtering, and basic aggregations.
Medium Queries
More complex queries involving grouping, aggregation functions, and joins.
Advanced Queries
Nested subqueries, window functions, CTEs, and performance optimization.<br>
**5. Query Optimization**<br>
In advanced stages, the focus shifts to improving query performance. Some optimization strategies include:
Indexing: Adding indexes on frequently queried columns.
Query Execution Plan: Using EXPLAIN ANALYZE to review and refine query performance.


**Query Optimization Technique**<br>
To improve query performance, we carried out the following optimization process:
Initial Query Performance Analysis Using EXPLAIN<br>
We began by analyzing the performance of a query using the EXPLAIN function.<br>
The query retrieved tracks based on the artist column, and the performance metrics were as follows:<br>
Execution time (E.T.): 7 ms
Planning time (P.T.): 0.17 ms

**SQL command for creating the index:**
```
CREATE INDEX idx_artist ON spotify_tracks(artist);
```
Performance Analysis After Index Creation
After creating the index, we ran the same query again and observed significant improvements in performance:
Execution time (E.T.): 0.153 ms
Planning time (P.T.): 0.152 ms<br><br><br>


This optimization shows how indexing can drastically reduce query time, improving the overall performance of our database operations in the Spotify project.
Technology Stack<br>
Database: PostgreSQL<br>
SQL Queries: DDL, DML, Aggregations, Joins, Subqueries, Window Functions<br>
Tools: pgAdmin 4 (or any SQL editor), PostgreSQL (via Homebrew, Docker, or direct installation)<br>

**How to Run the Project**<br>
Install PostgreSQL and pgAdmin (if not already installed).<br>
Set up the database schema and tables using the provided normalization structure.<br>
Insert the sample data into the respective tables.<br>
Execute SQL queries to solve the listed problems.<br>
Explore query optimization techniques for large datasets.<br>

**Next Steps**<br>
Visualize the Data: Use a data visualization tool like Tableau or Power BI to create dashboards based on the query results.
Expand Dataset: Add more rows to the dataset for broader analysis and scalability testing.
Advanced Querying: Dive deeper into query optimization and explore the performance of SQL queries on larger datasets.

**1. Retrieve the names of all tracks that have more than 1 billion streams.**
